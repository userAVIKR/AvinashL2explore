# Student Enrollment Form using JsonPowerDB

## 📌 Description

The **Student Enrollment Form** is a web-based application developed using **HTML, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and JsonPowerDB (JPDB)**.  
It allows users to **store, retrieve, and update student enrollment details** in a database efficiently.

The form uses **Roll Number as the Primary Key**, ensuring data integrity by preventing duplicate entries.  
Based on whether the Roll Number exists in the database, the system intelligently enables **Save** or **Update** functionality.

The project demonstrates real-time database interaction using **JsonPowerDB APIs** and is designed to be **NetBeans compatible**.
